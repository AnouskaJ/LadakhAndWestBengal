height="200" align="left">
The music of Bengal is a pleasure to listen to for anyone and everyone. It is indeed the jewel 
of Bengal’s heritage. The traditional Baul singing is perhaps the most popular of all. Mostly sung in 
praise of God with utmost reverence and focus, the singers can make anyone spellbound with their soothing music. 
During the performance, the performers shut out the entire outer world by closing their eyes and seem to be lost 
in a trance. Chhau, a very prominent tribal dance form of West Bengal, narrates stories from Indian epics. The performers 
wear colorful and vibrant masks, which helps them to portray different characters and convey the stories effectively.
